The code aims to find the `kth` factor of `n`, where `k` is a given positive integer.\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n- The code uses a simple iterative approach to find the `kth` factor of `n`. It initializes a variable `j` to keep track of the number of factors found. For each integer `i` from 1 to `n`, it checks if `i` is a factor of n by verifying if `n % i == 0`. If `i` is indeed a factor, it increments `j` and updates the variable `num` with the value of `i`.\\n\\n- The loop continues until `j` becomes equal to k or until all integers from 1 to n have been considered. If `j` becomes equal to `k`, it breaks out of the loop. At the end of the loop, if `j` is equal to `k`, it returns the value of `num`; otherwise, it returns `-1` to indicate that there is no `kth` factor.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: O(n)\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity: O(1)\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def kthFactor(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:\\n        j = 0\\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\\n            if n % i == 0:\\n                num = i\\n                j += 1\\n            if j == k:\\n                break\\n        return num if j == k else -1\\n```",

As such, we can consider this one with not too much of a stretch of the mind. \\n\\nEach integer value in our selected string has a list of indices at which it appears. IF we make a mapping of these list of indices for each value in order of appearance in s, we can use that against the ordering of appearance of list of values in t (we do not necessarily need to make said list of t, but could if we so chose) \\n\\nOnce we have this map, our first bet is to actually get the set of unique items in t, which can be done rather nicely with generators that will do the autoskip inclusions as needed. \\n\\nUsing unique t, our first check is that all of the unique t values are present. If not, then we can skip to returning False. \\n\\nOtherwise, we need to loop over t, and for each character check if it is in our map. If not, also False. \\n\\nIf we then loop over values up to this point (such that if we drew say 5 we\\'d go from 0 to 4 inclusive) we need to find that the value is in indexes and that the indexes at that point has a starting value at least as advanced or more so than the indexes for the drawn values first appearance. If this does not occur, then they are not in ascending order and may also return False. \\n\\nIf all of that passes, we need to discard the current item at the front of indexes at the drawn character. If in doing so we now eliminate that list, we need to eliminate the character drawn from indices entirely (this is why we have that second check for inclusion near the top). \\n\\nIf we manage all of that, there\\'s nothing to stop the transformation and can return True. \\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nUse collections default dict with collections deque for each character valuation in s \\n\\nMake a map of the character values -> list of indices of occurrence in order from first to last \\n\\nMake a set of unique t values \\n\\n- For each unique t value in unique t values \\n    - if that value is not in our mapping \\n        - return False \\n\\nLoop over t (effectively getting the unique indices for each value of t) \\n- as you do, convert your character into its designated key (This is here for other mapping versions of the problem) \\n- if we do not have that designated ky in our map \\n    - return false \\n- otherwise, loop over lesser character designations in range to character designation \\n    - if we have the map at lesser character designation and the map at lesser character designation points to a list whose first index of occurrence is less than the first index of occurrence of our current character designation, it must be that they are not in order, and can return False \\n- after completing lesser character loop, remove the most recent occurrence of indexes at character designation by popping left from the map at the character designation \\n- if the map now points to an empty list for character designation, remove character designation from the map entirely.    \\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity : O(S + T)\\n    - O(S) to build s mapping \\n    - O(T) to build t unique characters \\n    - O(T) to loop over characters in T \\n        - within which we do at most O(5) work to loop in range of lesser characters on average \\n    - Total then is O(S + T + ~5T) -> O(S + C * T) -> O(S + T)  \\n\\n\\n- Space complexity : O(S + t) \\n    - Store O(s) lists of size to account for S, so O(S) \\n    - Store O(t) \\n    - Remove storage for potentially all of O(S) \\n    - Averages out to O(S + t) at worst  \\n\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def isTransformable(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool :\\n        # make a mapping of deque lists called indexes \\n        indexes = collections.defaultdict(collections.deque)\\n        # enumerate s \\n        for index, character in enumerate(s) :\\n            # indexes at the int cast of character has this index added to it  \\n            indexes[int(character)].append(index)\\n\\n        # get unique values in t \\n        unique_t_values = set([int(t_i) for t_i in t])\\n        # for t_v in unique t values \\n        for t_v in unique_t_values : \\n            # if not in indexes \\n            if t_v not in indexes :\\n                # return False as we are missing pieces  \\n                return False \\n        \\n        # loop over t in order given  \\n        for character in t : \\n            # get the characters integer designation \\n            character_designation = int(character)\\n            # update may cause new misses which may prevent future searches \\n            if character_designation not in indexes : \\n                return False \\n            # for index in range up to character designation \\n            for lesser_character in range(character_designation) : \\n                # if indexes at lesser character and indexes at lesser character lists 0th item is before indexes at character designations lists 0th item \\n                if indexes[lesser_character] and indexes[lesser_character][0] < indexes[character_designation][0] : \\n                    # our lists are not transformable, False \\n                    # this is because for any select string mapping of character designations that are greater than their sub indexes \\n                    # it must be such that the index priors sub mapping does not interfere with the index current mapping. \\n                    # this is detailed in the problem statement where they note that values must be in ascending order \\n                    return False \\n            # after consideration using this most recent index, remove it \\n            indexes[character_designation].popleft()\\n            # if length is now zero, remove it \\n            if len(indexes[character_designation]) == 0 : \\n                indexes.pop(character_designation)\\n        \\n        # if all characters able to sort, return it \\n        return True \\n```",

The function starts by initializing a queue and adding the initial board state and the number of moves (0) to the queue. It also initializes a set to keep track of the board states that have already been seen. The function then enters a while loop that continues until the queue is empty. In each iteration, the function takes the first board state and move count from the queue, and checks if the board state is the desired state. If it is, the function returns the number of moves. If not, the function uses a helper function get_neighbors to find all possible moves (by swapping the empty space with its neighboring tiles) and adds them to the queue. The function also adds the new board states to the set of seen states.

Anyway, here is the proof.\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nIn one direction, note that all four operations preserve this property. The starting pair (1, 1) has it since $gcd(1, 1)=1=2^0$, the first two operations preserve the gcd, and the last two operations can multiply the gcd by 2 (or not). Thus, gcd(a, b) can only be a power of 2.\\n\\nConversely, starting from (1, 1) and multiplying the first term repeatedly by 2 we can obtain any pair of the form $(2^n, 1)$, then subtracting $1$ from $2^n$ repeatedly we can obtain any pair of the form $(n, 1)$.\\n\\nMultiplying the second term by 2 repeatedly we can obtain any pair of the form $(n, 2^m)$, then by subtracting $n$ from $2^m$ repeatedly we can obtain any pair of the form $(n,\\\\ 2^m \\\\mod n)$.\\n\\nSuppose we want to obtain the pair (n, k), where k<n and gcd(n, k)=1. Consider the infinite arithmetic progression (n, n+k, n+2k, ...). By Dirichlet\\'s theorem, this progression contains infinitely many primes. Consider one of them: p=n+jk for some $j \\\\geq 0$.\\n\\nBy a slight generalization of [Artin\\'s conjecture](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ArtinsConjecture.html) (the generalization may need proof, but Artin\\'s conjecture was proved by Christopher Hooley, [\"On Artin\\'s Conjecture\"](https://eudml.org/doc/150785), in 1967, assuming the [Generalized Riemann Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Riemann_hypothesis)), there are infinitely many such p for which 2 is a primitive root of unity modulo p, meaning that $2^{p-1} \\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod p$ and $2^{k} \\\\not \\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod p$ for $0<k<p-1$.\\n\\nWe know we can obtain any pair of the form $(p,\\\\ 2^m \\\\mod p)$. Since p is prime, the multiplicative group $\\\\mathbb Z_p^*$ is cyclic. Since 2 is a generator (its order is equal to the order of the group), we can obtain any pair (p, k) where $1 \\\\leq k <p$ using powers of 2 modulo p, including the k we want.\\n\\nBut this is the same as (n+jk, k) and then by repeatedly subtracting k from n+jk we can obtain (n, k), as desired.\\n\\nBy symmetry (doing the same thing in reverse if necessary), we can obtain any pair (n, m) where gcd(m, n)=1. Finally, multiplying m and n by (possibly different) arbitrary powers of 2 we can obtain any pair whose gcd is a power of two.\\n\\nEdited: The initial proof was wrong and I corrected it.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: Logarithmic: $O(\\\\max(\\\\log a, \\\\log b))$.\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity: $O(1)$.\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def isReachable(self, targetX: int, targetY: int) -> bool:\\n        def gcd(a, b):\\n            while b:\\n                a, b=b, a%b\\n            return a\\n        d=gcd(targetX, targetY)\\n        while d!=1:\\n            if d&1:\\n                return False\\n            d>>=1\\n        return True\\n        \\n```",

Not all **swaps** are useful to us. In the above example, we don\\'t want to swap s1[0] with any s1[j].\\n\\n**Swaps** are only useful if they satisfy these conditions:\\n1. s1[i] != s2[i] *(the letter isn\\'t already in the correct position)*\\n2. s1[i] = s2[j]   *(we are moving s1[i] to a location where it matches)*\\n3. s1[j]! = s2[j]   *(the SECOND letter isn\\'t already in the correct position*)\\n\\n**Our approach is to find the first non-matching letter in s1. Then, we try all possible \"useful\" swaps.**\\n\\nSo, in the above example, the first non-matching letter is s1[3], or \"b\". Performing a **swap** with s1[4] and s1[6] are both \"useful\", because the \"b\" is moved to the right position.\\n\\nWe do both of these swaps.

To determine whether you can win the game or not, we need to look at the number of stones in the heap and find a pattern.\\n\\nLet\\'s consider the base cases first:\\n\\n- If there is only one stone, you can remove it and win the game.\\n- If there are two stones, you can remove one stone and win the game.\\n- If there are three stones, you can remove two stones and win the game.\\n\\nFor n=4, you cannot win the game, as you can remove at most three stones on your turn, and your friend can remove the remaining stones on their turn. Therefore, your friend will win the game.\\n\\nFor n=5,6,7, you can win the game. If there are 5 stones, you can remove one stone and reduce it to four stones, and your friend will be forced to remove one to three stones. In any case, you will be able to remove the last stone and win the game.\\n\\nSimilarly, if there are six stones, you can remove two stones, leaving four stones in the heap. Your friend will be forced to remove one to three stones, and you will be able to remove the last stone and win the game.\\n\\nIf there are seven stones, you can remove three stones, leaving four stones in the heap. Your friend will be forced to remove one to three stones, and you will be able to remove the last stone and win the game.\\n\\nWe can observe that for any n that is a multiple of four, you cannot win the game. For any other value of n, you can win the game.\\n\\nTherefore, to solve this problem, we need to check if n is a multiple of four or not.

We want to represent grid with a Quad-Tree.\nReturn the root of the Quad-Tree representing grid.\nA Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:\n\nval: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's. Notice that you can assign the val to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.\nisLeaf: True if the node is a leaf node on the tree or False if the node has four children.\n\n\nclass Node {\n    public boolean val;\n    public boolean isLeaf;\n    public Node topLeft;\n    public Node topRight;\n    public Node bottomLeft;\n    public Node bottomRight;\n}\nWe can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:\n\nIf the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.\nIf the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.\nRecurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.\n\n\nIf you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.\nQuad-Tree format:\nYou don't need to read this section for solving the problem. This is only if you want to understand the output format here. The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.\nIt is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].\nIf the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.",
